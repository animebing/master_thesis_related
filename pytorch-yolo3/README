Attention: before processing, warm up with one image(the first forward is very slow)

detect4files.py: do detections for all images of one video sequentially, show results using opencv and show processing time for each image
video_demo.py: do detection for one video using opencv, show results or store results in one new video.
generate_detections_npy.py & generate_detections_txt.py: store the detection results for one sequence in one numpy file or one txt file, because
the purpose of two scripts is different, so I write two different scripts.

Another thing I need to mention: there is also a pytorch-yolo2 repository, when you use the weights of yolo3 in that repository, the results 
are wrong, because the header of yolo2 and yolo3 in darknet is different, more information can refer to https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2/issues/39
