In order to train mask rcnn on kaist dataset, I have convert the kaist annotation to json file in advance, then I need to make
kaist data and annotation known for Detectron, which means to add kaist items in ./lib/datasets/dataset_catelog.py

Because I just want to do pedestrian detection, so here I turn off the mask branch in yaml config file by "MASK_ON: False", here 
"kaist_e2e_mask_rcnn_R-50-FPN.yaml" is the config file

In the original "infer_simple.py" file, the detection result is stored in a pdf file, which is not convenient for online check,
so I use opencv to show the detection result as soon as the image is processed.
